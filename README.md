# 42 São Paulo - Basecamp/Piscine 🏊‍♂️

> 20 of the most intense days of my life. I learned so much about coding and myself, met the most wonderful people and fell in love with École 42 and 42 São Paulo.

## 📖 About the Piscine

The 42 Piscine is an intensive 3-week coding bootcamp that serves as the selection process for École 42. Starting from absolute zero programming knowledge, participants dive deep into C programming and Unix fundamentals through peer-to-peer learning.

## 💭 Reflection

These may not be the best codes you'll find out there, but they work! This was my very first experience coding, and I'm incredibly proud of what I accomplished in only 20 days with minimal guidance but infinite support from the 42 community.

## 🛠️ Skills Developed

Through this intensive bootcamp, I gained hands-on experience with:

- **C Programming**: From basics to advanced concepts like pointers and memory allocation
- **Problem Solving**: Breaking down complex problems into manageable solutions
- **Unix/Linux**: Command-line proficiency and shell scripting
- **Git**: Version control and collaborative workflows
- **Debugging**: Finding and fixing errors efficiently
- **Peer Learning**: Collaborating and learning from fellow students
- **Time Management**: Balancing multiple projects under tight deadlines
- **Resilience**: Pushing through challenges and maintaining motivation
